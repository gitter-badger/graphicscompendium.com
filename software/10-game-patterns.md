For this lecture we are mostly just looking at some select patterns from this textbook:

[Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)

We'll also look at the **Component-Entity-System** pattern, which is part of the above textbook
but is also a very commonly used and discussed architecture for games.

Here's some resources:
