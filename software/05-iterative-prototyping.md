## Iterative Design

Tips for people who want to design games -

> The most important thing you can do is to get into an iteration cycle where you can measure the impact of your work,
> have a hypothesis about how making changes will affect those variables, and ship changes regularly.
> It doesn't even matter that much what the content is -
> it's the iteration of hypothesis, changes, and measurement that will make you better at a faster rate than anything else we have seen.

## Project Management Frameworks

### The Waterfall Model

It’s a waterfall that takes you from the start of the project to the end.

Bonus question: What is "Verification" for us as game designers? Playtesting!


### Agile

There's a lot involved in the Agile project management framework that's outside of the scope of this course.
See: [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

For this class, just think about this:

You shouldn’t try to design your entire game first, and then travel down the waterfall.
Think in terms of trying to take small components of your game and go down a mini waterfall.
Try things out, prototype them, and test them.
