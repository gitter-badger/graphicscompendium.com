## Games Are Difficult

Why?

There are a lot of technologies to put together:

- Graphics
- Animation
- User interface design
- Sounds/audio
- Artificial intelligence

Putting everything together involves some difficulties:

- Timing and sequencing: need to keep track of what things are happening and when
- Performance: there's a lot going on and it needs to be fast to be playable

[The Door Problem](http://www.lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/)

- You need to find a mesh for the door
- It needs to be transformed in such a way that it can rotate about its hinge
- How do you open the door? Need to tie up a key press to the door opening
- Do you need to be close to it or do you need to look at it? Maybe we need picking
- Can you open a door when you're dead? Okay, we need to filter door controls
- What happens if the character is in the doorway and the door is closed?
  - Pushed out or stopped door?
- Is there a sound effect associated with the door?
- Are AI characters aware the door is open/closed?
  - It's a piece of the scene that can sometimes be seen through, sometimes not
